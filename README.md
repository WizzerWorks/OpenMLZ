# OpenML Reference Implementation

OpenMLÅ½ is a royalty-free, cross-platform programming environment for capturing, transporting, processing, displaying, and synchronizing digital media - including 2D/3D graphics and audio/video streams. OpenML was developed by the Khronos Group and is currently an inactive standard.

See the Khronos Group OpenML web site, https://www.khronos.org/openml/, for more information.

This repository was created to provide access to legacy software that is no longer available from the original Sourceforge project site (see https://sourceforge.net/projects/oml-ri/) because it used the obsolete CVS source control versioning system.

Currently there is no plan to update this project so that it will build for the Linux and Windows platforms. But that decision may change in the future; contributors are welcome to provide an updated build (i.e. CMake?).
