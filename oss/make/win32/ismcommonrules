# ismcommonrules - Common build rules for inclusion in the ISM top level
#	Makefile. This file automatically includes commonrules.
#
# See the man page sgibuild(7) for information on the use of this file
# and its role in the SGI build environment.
#
# Note that the commands for certain rules use recursive invocations of
# make at the same directory level instead of simply depending on the
# specific target. The reason for this is to assure proper sequencing of
# the dependent targets when a multijob (-j > 1) build is done. Some
# versions of make allow parallel builds to be selectively disabled
# (e.g. using the .NOTPARALLEL target) but GNU make does not provide
# this feature.
