#
# Spec file for the Example ISM
#
# The syntax and semantics of the file are identical to that of an
# RPM(8) spec file with the added flexibility of using arbitrary macros.
# There are four classes of macros that can be specified:
#
# 1. RPM Defined Macros
#       These are specified using the syntax $macro_name. The following
#       macros are defined by RPM:
#
#       RPM_SOURCE_DIR      - The location of the source archive
#       RPM_BUILD_DIR       - The location of the build directory
#       RPM_DOC_DIR         - The default location for documentation (/usr/doc)
#       RPM_OPT_FLAGS       - RPM build options
#       RPM_ARCH            - Build system architecture
#       RPM_OS              - Build system operating system
#       RPM_BUILD_ROOT      - Root location for all install targets
#       RPM_PACKAGE_NAME    - Package name (use ISM_NAME below)
#       RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION - Package version (use ISM_VERSION below)
#       RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE - Package release number (use PKG_RELEASE below)
#
# 2. SGI Build Defined Macros
#       These are specified using the syntax $(macro_name). While
#       additional macros can be defined by Makefiles using the LSPECVARS
#       macro, the following core set of macros are always defined:
#
#       ISM_NAME        - Name of the ISM (e.g. example)
#       ISM_VERSION     - Version number of the ISM (e.g. 1.0)
#       PKG_SOURCE_NAME - Name of the source archive
#       PKG_RELEASE     - Package release number
#       PKG_BUILDER     - Builder of the package
#       PKG_DIST        - Distribution name
#
# 3. Environment Variables
#       All environment variables are available using the syntax
#       $(variable_name).
#

#
# Do not change the following seven entries
#
Name: $(ISM_NAME)
Version: $(ISM_VERSION)
Release: $(PKG_RELEASE)
Distribution: $(PKG_DIST)
Packager: $(PKG_BUILDER)
BuildRoot: /var/tmp/$(ISM_NAME)
Source: $(PKG_SOURCE_NAME)

#
# Change the following as appropriate

#
# The setting of the Group tag should be picked from the list
# of values pre-defined by Red Hat in the file /usr/doc/rpm-<version>/GROUPS.
# The value is similar to a directory path (e.g. "Networking/Daemons").

%description
This package contains an example dmSDK software null codec.

%prep
%setup

%build
make

#
# The install targets must install relative to our ISM rather than
# relative to the root directory. To do this DIST_ROOT is defined
# for each Makefile using the RPM_BUILD_ROOT environment variable.
# This variable is given its value from an rpmrc file that is
# automatically created by the build environment during packaging.
#
# Also demonstrated here is the method for installing symbolic
# links. The link 'howdy' is created by the install target in the Makefile.
# A corresponding entry for the link must be made in the %files section.
#
%install
make DIST_ROOT="$RPM_BUILD_ROOT" install

#
# It is required to explicitly specify file and directory attributes. 
# The mode field may be left to default, '-', but the owner and group
# must be explicitly specified or RPM will use the owner and group name
# of the person doing the build. Also notice the use of macros that were
# defined in ismdefs using the LSPECVARS macro (e.g. ISM_DOC_DIR).
#
# RPM is VERY picky about removal of directories on uninstall. If
# you do not explicitly create a directory in the spec file, it
# will not be removed if empty. This will lead to an error message
# on uninstalling. To avoid this, explicitly create every new directory
# and its subdirectory.
#
%files

%attr(-, root, root) %dir $(ISM_MLMODULE_DIR)

#       Note the use of the '*' wildcard to install all versions of the
#       libhello shared library (i.e. executable and links).

%attr(755, root, root) $(ISM_MLMODULE_DIR)/nullxcode.so*
